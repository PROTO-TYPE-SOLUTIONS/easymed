"""
Accompaniments -- the consumables an item drags along with it.

An injectable drug is not dispensable on its own: it needs a syringe and a
swab, and those come out of stock whether the injection happens in the ward or
at the patient's home. A urea test needs a syringe, a swab and a container. A
box of Panadol tablets needs nothing.

This module answers three questions and nothing else:
  what does this item need   -> requirements()
  can we cover it right now  -> availability() / check_available()
  take it out of stock       -> consume()

Quantities are in base units throughout, which is also the unit invoice lines
are counted in.
